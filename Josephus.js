/**Josephus Problem
 * There are n people standing in a circle waiting to be executed.
 * The counting out begins at some point in the circle and proceeds around the circle in a fixed direction.
 * In each step, a certain number of people are skipped and the next person is executed.
 * The elimination proceeds around the circle (which is becoming smaller and smaller as the executed people are removed), until only the last person remains, who is given freedom.
 * Given the total number of persons n and a number k which indicates that k-1 persons are skipped and kth person is killed in circle.
 * The task is to choose the place in the initial circle so that you are the last one remaining and so survive.
